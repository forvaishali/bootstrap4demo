Adding .img-fluid to each image to makes it responsive.

Each item in our gallery will take up 4 columns (remember, col-md-4 for medium devices, col-lg-4 for large devices). That’s equal to 33.33333% on large devices such desktops and large tablets, and 12 columns on a small device (like iPhone, mobile devices) will take up 100% of the container.

Cards
Cards in Bootstrap 4 make blog design so much easier. The cards are appropriate for articles and posts.

To create a card, we use the class .card and assign it to a div element,

The card class contains many features:

.card-header: define card header
.card-body: for the card body
.card-title: the title of the card
card-footer: define the footer of the card.
.card-image: for the card’s image

Team Section

In this section we will use the grid system to distribute even space between images. Each image takes up 3 columns (.col-md-3) of the container — that equals 33.3333% of the total space.

Contact

The Contact Form section will contain a form through which visitors can send an email or give feedback. We will use some Bootstrap classes to make the design beautiful and responsive.

Like Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4 also uses the .form-control class for input fields, but there are some new features added — like switching from .input-group-addon (deprecated) to .input-group-prepend (to use icons as labels ).

See Bootstrap 4 document-https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/#input-groups for more information. In our Contact form we will wrap each input between a div that has the class .form-group.

we are going to use the Google Font API, and we’ll choose Raleway which is a nice font and appropriate to our template.

Add this link into your main.css file:

@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway');

For scroll effect. Here, we’ll have to use some JQuery. 

Bootstrap 4 is a great option for building your web application. It delivers high quality of UI elements and it’s easy to customize, integrate and use. It will also help you to include responsiveness in your website, therefore delivering a premium user experience to your users."# bootstrap4demo"
